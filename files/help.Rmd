# Trade validation tool

The interactive tool for trade data validation allows to query the total and bilateral trade datasets,
and eventually apply corrections to the bilateral flows.
Any modification to the bilateral flows is immediately visible in the tool.
Once the validation is completed, modified data can be sent back to SWS,
where its can be saved to the dataset.

## Authentication

To use the tool, you will need to authenticate to the SWS.
The steps for doing so are (all mentioned datasets are in the "Trade" domain):

1. create a session in the "Total Trade (CPC)" dataset
  1. in the country field, insert the country name/code of the reporter that you will validate
  1. in the remaining fields you can put whatever you like
  1. click on "Run"<br /><br />
     ![Query total][query_total]
  1. rename the session to something that you remember (here it will be "trade_CO_TOT")<br /><br />
     ![Rename total][rename_total]
1. create a session in the "Completed Trade Flow (CPC)" dataset
  1. in the first country field, insert the country name/code of the reporter that you will validate
  1. select the other dimensions
  1. click on "Run"<br /><br />
     ![Query complete][query_complete]
  1. rename the session to something that you remember (here it will be "trade_CO_BIL")<br /><br />
     ![Rename complete][rename_complete]
  1. click on "Run plugin" in the session on the complete trade dataset (in the example above, in trade_CO_BIL)<br /><br />
     ![Run plugin][run_plugin]
  1. select "[FAODOMAIN/mongeau] TRADEvalidation"
  1. select the session you created in the "Total Trade (CPC)" dataset
  1. click on "Get debug token"<br /><br />
     ![Get token][get_token]
  1. copy the token<br /><br />
     ![Copy token][copy_token]
1. open <http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org:3838/TRADEvalidation_test/> (well, this.)
1. click on the red button on the upper left corner on the page (it says "Token")<br /><br />
   ![Click token][click_token]
1. paste the token you copied before and click "OK"<br /><br />
   ![Enter token][enter_token]

After you do these steps,
if everything goes fine,
you will see your username in the button in the upper left corner (and it should become green).

![Successful authentication][successful_authentication]

You are now authenticated, and can start/continue your validation.

Please note that the country you selected in your session (i.e., the country
that you will validate), will appear in the "Country" menu. At this point
you can start your validation by

1. selecting the "Outliers" tab
1. selecting the "Main items" tab

If you want to have a look at a specific flow/item you can choose this combination by filling the "Flow" and "Item" menus in the upper side of the page.
Also, you can modify the start and end years in the "Years to show" sliders,
but once you do so avoid changing them in middle of a validation of a flow/item combination
(to see why, read the final notes at the bottom of the page).

Below are described the contents of the tool's tabs.

## Tool tabs

### Welcome

This is the first tab you see when you arrive here.
It contains a small reminder on what you find and a "recommended workflow".
If you don't feel to read all this help document again,
just go there to have a brief reminder of this tool's features.


### Outliers

When you select this tab,
total imports and exports for **all** items will be
downloaded and the outliers routine will be applied to them.
A table with the flow/items that display at least one outlier will be displayed.
The outlier(s) will be higlighted in red.

When you click on a cell, a popup window will display the value / quantity and utnit value of that flow/item,
and the outlier will be shown with a black point.
You can select to "Ignore" the item
(this will simply close the popup),
or "Analyze".
If you select the latter,
you will be redirected to the "Total" tab (see below).


### Main items

Here you will see the top-10 items for the country,
grouped by flow
(imports and exports)
and type of item
(tons, heads, 1,000 heads).

Not necessarily the flow/items here contain outliers,
but given that these flow/items represent the most important ones for the country,
you will need to have a look in any case.

As for the "Outliers" tab,
when you select a cell,
you will be redirected to the "Total" tab
(no popup window will appear, you will be redirected right away).

By default, only the main flow/items by quantity are shown.
If you want that also the main items by value appear,
you need to click on the box "Also main items by monetary value?".


#w# Total

This tab is splitted into four components.
The first one contains options and an "undo last modification" button.
The second one is a table with values,
quantities and unit values for the selected flow/item at the **total** trade level.
The third one shows by default the plot of the series in the tab above (and eventually other information).
The fourth one (under the plot),
shows by default some bilateral flows of the selected total.

The options are:

- "Show flags?" will show flags of the data if TRUE,
  hide them if FALSE
  (by default this is FALSE, so that you can focus on the data; if you need to understand if data are official, estimates, etc., set it to TRUE).
- "Show mirror?" will download all bilateral flows of the partners for the selected flow/item,
  and will aggregate them so that you can see what the sum of other countries say about that item for the selected country.
  By default this is FALSE,
  mainly because the data that needs to be downloaded is quite large,
  so it will slow down the app.
  Set it to TRUE if you are ready to wait.
- "Show Production?" will show production data taken from the "SUA unbalanced" dataset.
  This is probably more useful for exports,
  as countries usually export less than what they produce
  (actually, you should consider also imports and eventualy stocks, so that X <= P + M - S (exports are less or equal availability),
  but in any case having a look also to production data can be useful).
  By default this is FALSE,
  if you set it to TRUE the time required to get the data is not that much.
- "Minimum trade share of partner" is a number X between 0% and 50%
  (by default 20%)
  that will filter out from the bilateral table countries that never accounted for X% in the total flow for the selected item of the partner.
  For instance,
  if you set this to 30%,
  you will see all partners in the table at the bottom of the page that in at least one year accounted for at least 30%.
  This is useful so that you have a look either to main partners
  (those that usually account a lot for the reporter)
  or countries that because an outlier show a high percentage over the partner's flow.
  You will notice that even if the default is 20%,
  sometimes it scales automatically to a lower number:
  this happens because no partner accounted for 20%,
  so the maximum share will be selected automatically.

There is an "Undo last modification" button, but what it does will be explained later.

The first table contains data for the total flow for the selected flow/item/years:
values, quantities, and unit values.
When you do corrections in the "Bilateral" tab,
this table will be updated with corrected data.

The plots under the total table,
shows the data in that table.
It will also show mirror and/or production data if these options are set to TRUE.
Moreover, if you click on one cell of the table that contains bilateral flows (under the plots),
you will see that partner series appear also in the plots.

In the bottom table,
you see bilateral data for the selected flow/item.
As explained above,
by default you will see only the "main" partners (as per "Minimum trade share of partner" option).
If you really need to see **all** partners you can set the "Minimum trade share of partner" to 0 (zero).
Be aware that if you do so,
the browser will be slowed down a bit.
In any case, if you click on a cell, if it contains data, the series for the partner you selected will also be shown in the plots.


### Bilateral

In this tab you can see bilateral flows,
with some useful information,
and can correct them, if required.

Select a partner in the "Partner" menu.
Note that:
1) only available partners for the selected flow/item are shown,
so you don't need to figure out what countries to choose;
2) the partner shuould be automatically populated if you select it in the bilaterals that appear in the "Total" tab.

If there are years that can be corrected (corrections can be done just after 2014, included),
then available years will be displayed in the "Year to correct" menu.

You can select what variable to correct in the "Variable to correct" menu (it can be either "Quantity" or "Value").

There are different types of corrections that can be applied in the "Type of correction" menu:

* **None**:
  This should be used to confirm that an outlier is OK and should not be corrected.
  It can seem weird to correct by not applying any correction,
  but this may be thought more as a signal for future analysts (or yourself) that even if the observation seems an outlier,
  it was confirmed not to be so and who will again find this figure will not lose any time by revalidating it (is they read the metadata).
* **Measurement factor**:
  This can be useful if the quantity or value may have been reported with a wrong measurement unit,
  by a factor of 10.
  If you choose this option,
  it will be displayed below if the ratio of the unit value to the median unit value is "near" a factor of 10,
  and will suggest which factor is the most likely.
  More technically,
  the ratio between the unit value and the median unit value is computed;
  if this ratio is greater than or less than (with a 10% approximation)
  $10^(round(log10(ratio)))$
  then it means that the transaction was likely reported with a unit of measurement (of a factor of 10) issue.
* **Mirror flow**:
  Use the flow of the partner, if it exists
  (if it does not, you will get a feedback indicating that).
* **Outlier correction**:
  It is possible to use three different types of correction
  (in all cases, the values of these figures will be printed,
  if available, so that you can choose the most appropriate):
    - **Median partners**: median with respect to all partners,
      that is, the median for the reporter's trade
      (import or export specific)
      in the year of interest of the analysed commodity to all its partner is used.
    - **Median world**: median of the unit value of all reporters to all partners,
      that is, the median of all the reporters that traded
      (import or export specific)
      the analysed commodity in the year of interest is used.
    - **Moving average**: the three year-moving average
      (starting from the year previous to the one analysed)
      of the unit value of the trade flow of the commodity of the analysed reporter.
* **Publication/website**: when you find data on a publication or website.
* **Expert knowledge**: literature or otherwise justified figure,
  in other words,
  this is a figure that you set based on your own estimate.


When you select one type of correction,
appropriate submenus will be shown if required,
and there is some information on what would be the effect of applying that correction.

When you wan to actually see the effect of a correction both at the bilateral level and at the total level,
click on "Apply correction".
This will make the corrected data to be sent to the plots in this tab,
to the bilateral table in the "Total" tab,
and consequently to the table with the totals in the "Total" tab.

If you do not want that correction to be saved,
click on the "Undo last modification" button.
The button is replicated both in this tab and in the "Total" tab.
When you do so,
the status of the tables and plots will be brought back to the status they were just after you clicked on "Apply correction".

If you are happy with your correction,
you can send it to the list of corrections that will be saved by clicking on "Confirm correction".
Note that this will accumulate the correction in a pool of corrections that will be saven in the "Save" tab.
More on this later.

### Corrections

This tab contains a list of existing corrections.

You can remove corrections that are **already** saved,
by clicking on "Delete selected correction".
Again, this wil remove corrections that were saved (those shown in the "Corrections" tab),
not the corrections that you have not committed yet (those shown in the "Save" tab).


### Save

This tab contains a list of corrections that are ready to be saved.
To do so,
you need to click on "Send to SWS datasets".
What this action will do is that all corrections will be stored in the "correcitons table",
which is a dataset of already saved corrections,
and will send corrected data to SWS.

You will need to click on "Send to SWS datasets" for each combination of flow/items that you corrected.
If you do not do it,
and select another flow, item or years, you will lose all your corrections.


### Raw data / MAP

This was imported from the previous Shiny tool,
but probably will require some re-writing because it seems not to have been used much after all
(likely it was not made clear how this should be used).

Changes to the trademap need to be cleared by officers,
so contact one of them if you need to change a map entry.

### Help

This tab you are reading right now.


## Final notes / recommendations

Please consider that the tool was designed so that you can validate one country at a time,
and do so by going by flow and item.
For instance,
let's say you need to validate Colombia,
then after you do the authentication steps,
you go by flow/item combinations,
e.g., you first validate all imports of wheat,
then validate
all export of bananas,
then... you got it.
"Validate all" means that,
e.g., you check if the total imports of wheat is an outlier,
then if it seems so you go and validate all partners that make sense to validate
(usually the "main" partners)
with the tools available in the tool
(e.g., apply a measurement factor, a mirror flow, etc.)
and once all your corrections to bilateral flows of imports of whats are done,
save corrections and send the data to SWS. When you **end** with imports of wheat,
you do the same for exports of bananas.
When you finish with exports of bananas... you got it.
When you finish analysis and (eventually) corrections for all flows and all items,
you can conclude your validation by finally going to SWS and confirming that data is to be saved in the two sessions you created.

*There is a technical reason why you should validate one flow/item at a time:
each time you select another flow or item
(and for that matter, even if you change the years),
the tool will make a new query and you will lose all your corrections.*

You can do any query you like within the tool,
but for validation purposes,
limit yourself to the flow/items that are shown in the "Outliers" tab and in the "Main items" tab,
as they will show the flow/items that may be outliers and those that are most important for the country,
respectively.

The tool allows you to do "multiple corrections" to correct ALL bilateral flows in one go.
Please, use this very cautiously.
If you find, e.g., that ALL partners's quantities are to be divided by 1,000,
this may be better handled at the source of the data.
It could be useful to liase with UNSD so that in a coordinated manner these flows get fixed.
All agencies will benefit from this.
Also, another reason why this needs to be used conservatively is that it
will be difficult to "undo" all corrections (after they are saved) if they were made by mistake
(it happens: for instance you selected 100 when indeed you wanted to select 1,000).
Finally, it can be that you just spotted that the main partner needed to be fixed by a factor,
then assumed also all other partners needed such adjustment,
but later find that seen from the partner side all other corrections do not make sense.
